## This is a sample site created to test the integration of Google Analytics with TikTok

I encountered an issue while connecting my TikTok account to Google Analytics, as it displayed a "no data has been received" error message due to the website not being tagged with the Measurement ID. I couldn't insert the Google Tag code on the TikTok source page as it is not open for editing and ought to contact the site administrator for access. Despite trying UTM parameters and installing the TikTok pixel via Google Tag Manager, it still didn’t work.

To troubleshoot, I created a sample website that acts as a landing page embedded with TikTok, iOS, and Android download sites to integrate Google Analytics with TikTok and advertise to download the Spurpunk TD Game app. The site includes buttons that redirect to TikTok, iOS, and Android download sites which eventually helps to generate traffic. I also updated my TikTok bio, reel’s description, and  comments with the website link and UTM parameters to increase the reach.
